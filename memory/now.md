# Current project truth

## Purpose

Track the current state and next safe action for the Laters personal read-later PWA.

## Lifecycle

The original personal MVP and all three MVP 2.0 slices are implemented, published and accepted at
`https://laters.dustyb.in/`. Release `v0.1.0` records the first-MVP baseline; `v0.2.0` records the
completed bookmark, source-marker and whole-row-opening release.

## What exists now

- The committed AI Project Foundation baseline and local no-AI-attribution guards.
- Canonical product intent in `memory/intent.md`.
- Detailed MVP behaviour, acceptance criteria and delivery slices in `docs/mvp-definition.md`.
- The original idea archived in `evidence/origin/2026-08-21-origin.md`.
- A framework-free TypeScript application built with Vite 8.
- A small `ReadingListStore` contract with a native IndexedDB implementation.
- An accessible responsive reading list with newest-first ordering, original-link opening, immediate deletion and clear empty, success and failure states.
- Focused automated tests for input validation, saved-time formatting, IndexedDB persistence, deterministic ordering and deletion.
- A complete installable-PWA manifest with 192px and 512px app icons.
- A precaching service worker that serves the application shell offline.
- A `POST` Android Web Share Target that validates shared data, supports URLs embedded in Android's text field, saves through the existing IndexedDB boundary and redirects to an accessible result state.
- Accepted deployment and interaction decisions recorded in canonical intent and the MVP definition.
- A GitHub Pages deployment workflow that tests, builds, audits and publishes only `dist/`.
- The repository's Pages source is configured for GitHub Actions and the production workflow has deployed successfully.
- A repeatable public-build audit covering common secrets, personal data, local paths, source maps, repository documents, binary metadata and unintended external resources.
- Duplicate shares refresh one item at the top, deletion offers an accessible seven-second undo action, relative times refresh on foregrounding, and persistent storage is requested non-fatally.
- Maintained deployment behaviour and physical-device acceptance guidance for `laters.dustyb.in` without recording the maintainer's personal DNS provider or account setup.
- A live custom-domain deployment with an approved GitHub certificate and enforced HTTPS.
- A public source repository whose README links directly to the installable live application and explains that every installation keeps its saved list locally.
- Routine changes may be committed directly to `main`; pull requests are optional unless requested or useful for separate review.
- Physical-device installation, standalone launch, Android Share-menu discovery and valid capture verified on Chrome for Android `151.0.7922.173`.
- A user-controlled service-worker update flow that preserves same-origin IndexedDB data and reloads only after the **Update** action is selected.
- Complete physical-device MVP acceptance on Chrome for Android `151.0.7922.173`, including exact-URL duplicate refresh, persistence, deletion, Undo and the offline shell.
- A Claude Design handoff that defines the implemented feature and state contract, icon deliverables, accessibility requirements and strict MVP scope boundary.
- The accepted white/ink/lime identity, self-hosted Bricolage Grotesque typeface, supplied icon family, accessible icon-only Delete control and in-row seven-second Undo state.
- A published `v0.1.0` GitHub release tagged at verified rewritten commit `0178fc9`.
- Published and maintainer-accepted MVP 2.0 bookmarks with the bright-lime supplied star treatment.
- Published and maintainer-accepted 22px publisher source markers with exact-origin favicon attempts,
  deterministic local fallbacks and the refined 4px first-title-line alignment.
- Published and maintainer-accepted whole-row pointer opening that preserves the semantic title
  link and excludes Bookmark, Delete, selection, scrolling and Ghost/Undo interactions.
- A complete `v0.2.0` release record covering scope, privacy, data compatibility, verification,
  physical Android acceptance and deliberately deferred work.

## Active focus

Maintain the accepted `v0.2.0` release and select any future product work through a new bounded
decision rather than extending MVP 2.0 implicitly.

## Active slice

No implementation slice is active. MVP 2.0 is complete and released as `v0.2.0`. Persistent
bookmarks, publisher source markers with deterministic fallbacks and safe whole-row pointer opening
all passed automated, deployment and focused physical Android acceptance. The local-only data model,
existing IndexedDB structure, newest-first ordering, share capture, Delete/Undo, update flow and
offline shell remain intact.

## Blockers

None.

## Uncertainties

- A minimum Chrome for Android version is not yet evidenced.
- Android's news feed may provide distinct rotating or tracking URLs for the same apparent article; exact-URL deduplication correctly retains these as separate items.
- Some Android news-feed shares do not supply a useful article title. Remote title enrichment is a possible later product slice with privacy, security and reliability implications; it is not part of the current design handoff.

## Next safe action

Do not begin another feature by default. If the maintainer chooses to pursue long press, an action
sheet or swipe-to-delete, first run the bounded architecture investigation required by the MVP 2.0
definition. Other ideas remain exploratory and need their own evidence and accepted scope.

## Last meaningful update

2026-08-22 — The maintainer accepted Slice 3 and confirmed the complete MVP 2.0 experience works as
intended. Release closure selected semantic version `v0.2.0`, reconciled stale planning language,
updated the public feature and privacy description, recorded all three delivery slices and physical
acceptance, and retained the separate architecture gate for any future gesture shell.
